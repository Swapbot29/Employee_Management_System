So starting the project with creating models
class-Department - with attributes ( D_Name,Floor ).
class-Employee - with attributes ( First_Name, Last_Name, Email, Address, Designation, Reporting_Manager, Department ).
class EmployeeSalary - with attributes ( Employee, salary, start_date and end_date ).
after creating models we have to make migrations and migrate to commit the changes to datebase and create table in database.

It will take half an hour to setting up models and ensuring proper relationship.

Then create a superuser to add temporary data into tables.
tThen setup the admin page by registering the models into admin site.

It will take half an hour to registering and implementing some classes for list display and filters.

Then create views to display all list data of the employee table and all the CRUD operations for the table and same for department and employee salary details table.

we will go one table at a time to ensure the data is rendering on template or not then create forms.py and create forms models for updating and creating new data.

Views logic will take 3-4 hours to add logic for retrieving data and CRUD operations logic and calculating costs.

then create templates for each operation and add the template names to URLs pattern to link with views.

for all work, it will take 8-10 hours with testing the program.
